An eCommerce company, Northwind Trading, has been operating successfully for the past four years. Sales have been steady through this time, with some small seasonal fluctuations. However, last month's sales figures showed a downward trend for the first time, and the company also noticed that several customers posted negative comments on social media about the online store. 
Ali, the Northwind Trading website administrator, reported that the eCommerce website was redesigned a month ago. The redesign included implementing a new checkout process that now requires the customers to register before completing the sale. The registration was implemented because the marketing team needed to collect customer data for promotional purposes and to track purchase history. Ali has not noticed any technical issues with the website. Pages are loading slower than he would wish, however he expects that the performance will be dramatically improved once he has completed the optimization of all the product images. 
According to the report completed by Sua, the sales manager, there aren't any obvious problems with the sales. However,  Northwind Trading management believes that "it is better to be safe than to be sorry" and decide to investigate the situation before the sales problem gets any worse.
# Deliverable 1 - Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis 

** Scrutinize Northwind Trading March Sales Data (in the Sales Data and Statistics spreadsheet you downloaded)  and see if you can spot any trends. Are the sales growing, declining, or fairly stable? What about website visits? **

** Calculate March sales totals and average daily sales values, the number of transactions per day, and the average transaction value per period using the Sales Data and Statistics spreadsheet you downloaded. Once completed, please fill your answers in the DELIVERABLE 1 section of  Problem Identification and Stakeholder Management **

** Compare February and March totals. Calculate the difference in sales value and difference in percentage. Record it in the Problem Identification and Stakeholder Management **

** Read and analyze the customer complaints in the second download file - Sales Report and Customer Complaints. Is there a recurring theme? What are the customers unhappy about? You can add these complaints to the Sales Data and Statistics spreadsheet (create a new Customer Complaints Analysis tab). You must analyze and categorize the customer complaints. Read all the complaints and determine where complaints fall into the same category. The hashtags will help you with categorization but don't depend on them totally, read the complaint and use your own judgment to categorize it.  In the next column of the Complaints Analysis tab create a heading called ‘Complaint type’ and enter in your categorization of each complaint, for instance Checkout-issues or website speed issues. Then count the number of complaints per complaint type; e.g., "Checkout-issues:  5 complaints.” You will need this count of each category for your final recommendation to the Northwind Trading Management **

** Read the Sales Manager's report in the “Sales Report and Customer Complaints” file you downloaded in Step 1 of this exercise . Do you agree with her analysis of the situation? **
